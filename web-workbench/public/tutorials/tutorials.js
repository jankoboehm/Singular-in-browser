This repeats module-monomial comparisons using \`(c,lp)\`, where the component is compared before the monomial. The change makes $[0,x]>[y,0]$ false, because the second component has lower priority than the first component.

For the vector $f=[x,5x^2y+xy^2]$ in a free module with ordering \`(lp,c)\`, Singular computes the leading monomial, coefficient, and term. The leading term lies in the second component: $5x^2y\\,e_2$.

The same vector $[y+z,x+y]$ is examined under two module orderings. With \`(lp,c)\`, the leading monomial is $x e_2$; with \`(c,lp)\`, the first component has priority and the leading monomial is $y e_1$.`,
